# Web-Tech-Project

## Project Overview
The project entails constructing a service provider website employing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express. Users can register or log in, while companies can post their registration forms, detailing their requirements directly on the site.

To implement the sign-up and login functionality, we can use the bcrypt library to hash and compare passwords, and the jsonwebtoken library to generate and verify tokens. We can also use the cookie-parser library to parse cookies and set them in the response.
